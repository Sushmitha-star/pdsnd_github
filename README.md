### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis Project

### Description
The Bikeshare project is a Python-based program designed to explore and analyze bike share system data. Using CSV data files, such as new_york_city.csv, the project allows users to examine various aspects of bike usage, including trip duration, popular stations, and user demographics. The main goal of this project is to practice working with Python code, managing data files, and applying Git and GitHub for version control, including branching, committing, and merging changes. While the project includes code analysis, the primary focus is on simulating a real-world software development workflow using Git.

### Files used
bikeshare.py — the main Python code file for data analysis
new_york_city.csv — dataset containing bike share trip information
.gitignore — file to exclude large or sensitive files from Git tracking
README.md — project documentation

### Credits
Inspired by Udacity’s Bikeshare Project Template: Udacity Bikeshare Repository
Python and Git tutorials consulted:
Python Official Documentation
Git Documentation


## Usage

Run the bikeshare starter script with Python 3 (example):


Before running, copy one of the city CSV files (chicago/new_york_city/washington) into the repo root or place them in the working folder.
